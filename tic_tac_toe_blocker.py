#8 Tic Tac Toe blocker

"""In this Python challenge, write a function thatâ€™ll accept two numbers. 
These numbers will represent a position on a tic-tac-toe board. 
They can be 0 through 8, where 0 is the top-left spot, and 8 is the bottom-right spot.

These parameters are two marks on the tic-tac-toe board. The function should return the number of the 
spot that can block these two spots from winning the game."""
